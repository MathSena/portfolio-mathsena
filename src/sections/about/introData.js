    `Greetings! 👋 I'm Matheus Sena, a guy who loves to code, especially in Java. I like making things with Spring.

  I come from São Paulo 🇧🇷 but now I'm living and loving life in Lisbon 🇵🇹. By day, I'm all about Code and APIs; by night, I'm either studying for my MBA on Full Stack stuff, or geeking out on Java Architecture – it's just so cool. 😎

  When I'm not coding, I'm probably out taking photos 📸, reading 📖, running 🏃‍♂, doing yoga 🧘, or cheering for my favorite sports teams 🏈. I'm a big fan of coffee ☕, video games 🎮, music, Beatles and Amy Winehouse 🎶 , and just enjoying the little things in life 🌟.

  Glad you're here! Have a look around and let's talk about how we can work together on something fun and exciting! 🚀`
